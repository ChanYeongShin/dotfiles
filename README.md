# dotfiles
An attempt to create my own dotfiles


## Dependency (install on your own)
- vim
- tmux
- zsh
- tree
- bat


## Dependency (install script provided)
- oh-my-zsh
- fzf
- cdhist


## Installation
Run the installation script:
```
sh install_dependency.sh
sh_install_symlink.sh
```
It's likely that things do not work.
In that case, please install manually by following the scripts.


## Troubleshooting
```
zsh | characters not in range
```
